# 506-practice-workflow
This assignment is as a primer for 504/507 Fall semester classes to practice a basic development workflow

These variables are related to the course year, assignment file name, random list, and the introduction of the student (me).

This function is used to calculate the final grade and letter grade, the final grade is based on grade 1 and grade 2. If your grade >= 90, you can get an "A", otherwise you can only get a "B".
In my case, I got 92 on grade1 and 85 on grade2. So my final grade = 92*0.6+85*0.4 = 89.1999 < 90 ,so my letter grade is 'B'.
